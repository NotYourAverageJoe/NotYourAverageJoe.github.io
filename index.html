        <h2>Expected Experiences</h2>
        
        <p><em>My</em> favorite adventures  <strong>you should</strong> do in Espania on holiday should include;

<h3><li><strong>Go</strong> on a tapas crawl through Madrid</li></h3>

    <ol>When visiting Madrid you don’t want to miss the <strong>vibrant</strong> tapas scene and a chance to taste all the delicious Spanish food and drink that’s available to you in the city. One of the best ways to discover all of these delicacies is on a Madrid tapas crawl,<em> so get your stomachs and your walking shoes ready!</em></ol> <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bc/Tapas_de_jam%C3%B3n_y_queso.jpg/320px-Tapas_de_jam%C3%B3n_y_queso.jpg " alt="manchego and ham on crostini tapa" width= "197" height="125"></p>
        
             
            <p><li><h3><strong>Catch</strong> a Flamenco show in Seville</h3></li>
            
            <ol>For a truly authentic, rich cultural experience, seeing a flamenco show is one of the best things you can do in Spain. This traditional style of Spanish folk music <em>dates back to 500 years ago</em> and has a seductive quality to it through its dancing, guitar playing, and hand clapping. You can catch a flamenco show daily in cities like Madrid, Barcelona, Seville, Granada, and many more.</ol><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/11/Emojione_1F483.svg/240px-Emojione_1F483.svg.png"alt="clipart_of_a_flowy_dress_flamenco_dancer"width="50" height= "50"></p>
            
            
            
            
            <p><li><h3><strong>Discover</strong> El Caminito Del Rey</h3></li>
            
            <ol>El Caminito del Rey, also known as <em>‘the King’s little pathway’</em> is a walkway straddling the side of the El Chorro gorge near Ardales in the province of Malaga. <strong>This is not an experience for the faint-hearted!</strong> Adrenaline junkies can traverse the 3-kilometre walk along a 1-meter wide path, 100 meters above the gorge floor below. Originally built as a route for workers at the hydroelectric power plant nearby, it now attracts thrill seekers from around the world. <em>The path was closed for four years, reopening in 2015, following several deaths.</em> Now though, it is possible to traverse the Caminito far more safely, but the excitement remains. As far as points of interest in Spain go,<strong> this must be amongst the most hair-raising!</strong></ol> <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8c/Desfiladero_de_los_Gaitanes05.jpg" width="258" height="132" alt="cascading stone bridge connecting two land masses"></p>
            
           <p><h1 id="the_donts">The Dont's of enjoying Spain</h1>
           
           
            <p>While Spain is a beautiful and robust country with so much to do, there all things you should <strong>not</strong> do while visiting Spain</p>
            
    <ol>
        <li><strong> Don’t expect to eat early.</strong> Spain does everything late and eating is no exception. Lunchtime is usually between 13:00 – 15:30, and dinner is rarely served before 21:00.</li><br>
        
        <li><strong> Do not rush or take punctuality too seriously.</strong> Spanish tend to have a very relaxed sense of time, so be patient and just enjoy being in Spain!</li><br>
        
        <li><strong>Don’t limit yourself to Costa del Sol.</strong> Surely, this Andalusian stretch of coast is absolutely lovely, but parts of it can also be very touristy and expensive. Besides, there are other 12 beautiful coasts in Spain waiting to be explored, and all of them boast wonderful beaches, picturesque towns, and fabulous local cuisine.</li><br>
        
        <li><strong>Don’t plan anything important on Tuesday 13,</strong> or Tuesday in general. In Spain is not Friday the 13th that brings bad luck, but Tuesday. They even have a saying for it:  En martes, ni te cases, ni te embarques, ni de tu casa te apartes – On Tuesday, don’t get married, don’t board (on a ship or plane), and don’t leave the house.</li><br>
        
        <li><strong> Don’t stay in a tourist resort.</strong> Spain’s major coasts are packed with all kinds of tourist hotels and all-inclusive resorts, and most of them do offer all the comforts and amenities one would need for a pleasant holiday, but they’re also pretty expensive, dull, and unfriendly. So instead of spending all day by the pool with a bunch of tourists, why not trying to experience something new? Go out there, explore Spain on your own, connect with locals and their culture, try new foods, and be adventurous</li><br>
        
        <li><h1 id="the_big_dont">DONT BRING YOUR STRESSES WITH YOU!!</h1>Enjoy your life while visiting Spain.<em> Trust me</em>, it wont be hard to do.</li>
